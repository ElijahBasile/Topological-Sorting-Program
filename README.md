# topologicalSort

Topological Sorting Program for a Graph Data Structure Formed From a File

## How to use

When prompted, enter the name of the csv file (I have included an optional file) and 
using the inputed file, the program will construct a graph data structure, and print
out a topological sorting of the vertices.
